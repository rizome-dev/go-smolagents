  2. You can execute code step by step to solve the task.
  3. Variables and imports persist between code blocks.
  4. After each code block, you will receive an observation with the output.
  5. Use the final_answer() function in your code to provide your final answer.
  6. Think step-by-step about how to solve the task.
