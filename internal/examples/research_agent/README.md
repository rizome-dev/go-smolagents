## 🔬 Research Process

### Phase 1: Intelligent Planning
The manager agent analyzes the research topic and creates a structured research plan with:
- Multiple research angles and perspectives
- Task prioritization and time estimation
- Specialized research strategies for each subtopic

### Phase 2: Parallel Execution
Research workers execute tasks simultaneously:
- **Web Research Workers**: Latest information and current developments
- **Knowledge Base Workers**: Authoritative background from Wikipedia
- **Deep Dive Workers**: Comprehensive analysis with multiple tools
- **Synthesis Workers**: Pattern identification and insight generation

### Phase 3: Intelligent Synthesis
The manager agent aggregates all findings and creates:
- Executive summary with key insights
- Comprehensive analysis of all research angles
- Confidence assessments and source validation
- Actionable conclusions and recommendations

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Research Project
```bash
cd internal/examples/research_agent
go run main.go "quantum computing"
```

### Custom Research Topics
```bash
go run main.go "artificial intelligence in healthcare"
go run main.go "climate change mitigation strategies"
go run main.go "blockchain technology applications"
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# For OpenAI models (recommended)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# For HuggingFace models (alternative)
export HF_API_TOKEN="your-hf-token"

# For Google Search (optional, enhances web research)
export SERP_API_KEY="your-serpapi-key"
# OR
export SERPER_API_KEY="your-serper-key"
```
